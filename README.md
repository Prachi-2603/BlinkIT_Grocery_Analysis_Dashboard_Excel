## üìä BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analysis

This project contains a comprehensive analysis of the BlinkIT Grocery sales data conducted using **Microsoft Excel**. The goal was to extract key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze sales trends across different item and outlet characteristics, and visualize the findings on a dynamic dashboard.

## üíæ Data Source and Schema

The analysis is based on the dataset provided in `BlinkIT Data.xlsx - Sheet1.csv` (and `BlinkIT Grocery Excel Analysis.xlsx - Data.csv`), which contains transactional and descriptive information about various grocery items and the outlets where they were sold.

### Dataset Columns

| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Item Fat Content` | The fat content of the item (e.g., Regular, Low Fat). |
| `Sr No.` | Serial number. |
| `Item Identifier` | Unique code for each item. |
| `Item Type` | The category of the item (e.g., Snack Foods, Dairy, Soft Drinks). |
| `Outlet Establishment Year` | The year the sales outlet was established. |
| `Outlet Identifier` | Unique code for each sales outlet. |
| `Outlet Location Type` | The type of location (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3). |
| `Outlet Size` | The size of the outlet (e.g., Small, Medium, High). |
| `Outlet Type` | The type of retail establishment (e.g., Supermarket Type1). |
| `Item Visibility` | The percentage of total display area allocated to the product. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Approach

The analysis was performed using **Excel's data manipulation and visualization features**:

1.  **Data Cleaning/Preparation**: Ensuring data consistency (e.g., handling variations in 'Item Fat Content').
2.  **KPI Calculation**: Defining and calculating core performance metrics.
3.  **Pivot Tables**: Creating multiple Pivot Tables (documented in `Sheet Design.xlsx - Sheet1.csv`) to analyze sales by dimensions such as `Item Type`, `Item Fat Content`, `Outlet Location Type`, and `Outlet Establishment Year`.
4.  **Dashboard Creation**: Developing a final, interactive dashboard (`BlinkIT Grocery Excel Analysis.xlsx - Dashboard.csv`) to present the insights visually.

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs were calculated from the dataset:

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Total Sales** | **$248,991.59** |
| **Average Sales** | **$142.04** |
| **Total Number of Items** | **1,753** |
| **Average Rating** | **3.95** |

### Insights from Pivot Analysis

* **Sales by Fat Content**: **Regular** items generate a slightly higher total sales revenue ($126k) compared to **Low Fat** items ($122k).
* **Top Item Types by Sales**: **Snack Foods**, **Fruits and Vegetables**, and **Frozen Foods** are the leading categories in terms of total revenue.
* **Sales by Outlet Age**: The analysis tracks how sales vary based on the establishment year of the outlets, which is crucial for forecasting and resource allocation.
* **Sales by Location Type**: Performance is segmented by `Tier` location to understand regional sales contribution.
